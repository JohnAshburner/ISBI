\frametitle{General setting}
We have a training dataset of $n$ observations, each consisting of an input ${\bf x}_i$ and a target $y_i$.\par
Each input, ${\bf x}_i$, consists of a vector of $p$ features.
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{D} = \{({\bf x}_i,y_i) | i=1,..,n\}
\end{align*}

The aim is to predict the target for a new input ${\bf x}_*$.
